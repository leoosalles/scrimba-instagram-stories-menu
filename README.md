# scrimba-instagram-stories-menu
This project replicates an Instagram-style stories menu using HTML and CSS. It displays user profile pictures with dynamic indicators for new and viewed stories, along with a LIVE badge for active streams. The design mimics the familiar UI of Instagram stories, making it a great component for social media-inspired projects.
